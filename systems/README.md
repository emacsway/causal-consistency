## Papers

### NSDI
- [NSDI2017 (Wyatt Lloyd): I Can't Believe It's Not Causal! Scalable Causal Consistency with No Slowdown Cascades]()
- [NSDI2013 (Wyatt Lloyd): Stronger Semantics for Low-Latency Geo-Replicated Storage]()
> `Eiger`. The primary contributions of this work are enabling scalable causal consistency 
for the complex column-family data model, as well as novel, 
non-blocking algorithms for both read-only and write-only transactions.

### SOSP
- [SOSP2011 (Wyatt Lloyd): Do Not Settle for Eventual Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-Area Storage with COPS]()
> `COPS`. In this paper, we identify and define a consistency model: 
causal consistency with convergent conflict handling, or ***causal+***;
> We present the design and implementation of *COPS*,
a key-value store that delivers this consistency model across the wide-area.

### EuroSys
- [EuroSys2017 (Manuel Bravo): Saturn A Distributed Metadata Service for Causal Consistency]()

### ICDCS
- [ICDCS2016 (Manuel Bravo): Cure Strong Semantics Meets High Availability and Low Latency]()

### ATC
- [ATC 2017 (Manuel Bravo): Unobtrusive Deferred Update Stabilization for Efficient Geo-Replication]()
